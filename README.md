# 🚨 ResQHer – Real-time SOS & Location Tracking App for Women's Safety

> Because safety shouldn't be a luxury.  
> *A women-centric AI-powered safety solution designed to send real-time location and emergency alerts in distress situations.*

---

## 👩‍💻 Project Status: `In Progress`

ResQHer is currently under development as part of my personal initiative to **build tech that empowers women**. The core idea is to **provide real-time location tracking** and an **SOS trigger** that sends help alerts immediately when someone is in danger or stuck somewhere.

---

## 🌟 Key Goals

- 📍 **Live Location Tracking** – fetch user’s current coordinates automatically
- 🚨 **SOS Button** – instantly trigger alert messages with location data
- 🛰️ **Geolocation APIs** – display user’s path on an interactive map
- 🧠 **AI Expansion (Future)** – anomaly detection to auto-detect emergencies

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tool/Library      | Purpose                                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Python**        | Core logic and scripting                  |
| **Flask**         | Backend web framework                     |
| **Geopy**         | Fetch latitude and longitude of user      |
| **Folium / Leaflet.js** | [Planned] Display location on map         |
| **SMTP / Twilio API** | [Planned] To send SOS alerts (email/SMS)    |
| **HTML/CSS**      | Web UI for user interaction               |

## ✅ Current Progress

- ✅ Designed the project roadmap  
- ✅ Built basic location finder using **Geopy**  
- ✅ Integrated Flask to fetch and display coordinates  
- ⏳ Add SOS button with alert functionality  
- ⏳ Display map with real-time tracking  
- ⏳ Final UI + Deployment  

---

## 📍 How It Works (Planned Flow)

1. User opens the ResQHer app  
2. The app fetches their **current live location**  
3. User taps on the **SOS button**  
4. An emergency alert (with live location) is sent to trusted contacts via email or SMS  
5. Location is displayed on a **real-time map**

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Women often face unsafe situations where immediate help is critical. With **ResQHer**, the goal is to:

- Reduce response time during emergencies  
- Provide real-time awareness of user’s location  
- Build a **privacy-safe, minimal, and powerful** safety tool

---

## 🗺️ Future Additions

- 🔒 User authentication (for privacy and profile management)  
- 📡 Offline tracking mode using last known location  
- 🧠 ML-based detection for suspicious behavior patterns  
- 📱 Mobile version using Kivy or Flutter (eventually)
